# LoL Quick Reference Guide

## 🎯 Core Fundamentals
- **Lane Phase**: Farm > Trade > Kill
- **Win Conditions**: Identify early, adapt strategy
- **Power Spikes**: Level 2, 6, item completions
- **Objectives**: Dragon > Herald early, Baron > Elder late

## 📊 Wave Management
- **Freeze**: 3-4 enemy minions alive, deny farm when ahead
- **Slow Push**: Kill melee minions only, builds big wave
- **Fast Push**: All abilities on wave, for recalls/roams
- **Bounce**: Let wave push to you, freeze on return

## 🗺️ Vision Control
- **Priority Wards**: River > Jungle entrances > Deep wards
- **Timing**: Ward before objectives (1 min early)
- **Sweeping**: Clear vision before important plays
- **Pink Wards**: Defensive positioning, permanent vision

## ⚔️ Trading Patterns
- **Level 1-2**: Ability + AA, immediate retreat
- **Level 3+**: Extended trades when you have advantage
- **Minion Advantage**: Trade when you have more minions
- **Cooldown Windows**: Trade when enemy spells are down

## 🎮 Game Phases

## 🏆 Team Fighting
**Position Priority**: Back to front

**Engagement**: Wait for picks or force through vision

## 🧠 Mental Game

- **Communication**: Pings > Chat
- **Adaptation**: Build/strategy changes per game
- **Learning**: Review losses, not just wins
