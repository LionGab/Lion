# Example: AI-Designed City Research

## The Question
**"What would a city designed entirely by AI optimize for, and would humans want to live there?"**

## How the Research Team Tackles It

## Sample Findings Preview

### Assistant 1 Discovery
"Singapore's Smart Nation initiative uses AI to optimize traffic flow, reducing commute times by 15%. However, it requires 90,000 cameras and full vehicle tracking..."

### Assistant 2 Analysis  
"AI consistently optimizes for: 1) Maximum throughput, 2) Minimum resource usage, 3) Predictable behavior patterns. Human preferences for 'inefficient' spaces like parks score low..."

### Assistant 3 Critique
"The algorithm has no concept of 'soul' - no quirky bookshops, no hidden speakeasies, no graffiti walls. Everything that makes a city *alive* registers as inefficiency..."

### Assistant 4 Verification
"Brasília was designed for efficiency in the 1960s. Today, residents escape to unplanned satellite cities every weekend. Lesson: Humans reject over-optimization..."

## Other Cool Questions to Try

🌊 **"What would happen to Earth's climate if the ocean conveyor belt suddenly stopped?"**

🧬 **"Could we use CRISPR to create real-life Pokemon, and what would go wrong?"**

🎮 **"How would society change if we could upload skills like in The Matrix?"**

⚛️ **"What would archaeology look like on a planet with 10x Earth's gravity?"**

🤖 **"If AIs developed their own language, what would they talk about when humans aren't listening?"**

Each question benefits from the multi-angle approach:
- Facts from credible sources
- Deep analysis of implications
- Critical/contrarian perspectives  
- Verification of claims

The Head Researcher + Research Assistants model gives you comprehensive, nuanced answers that no single agent could produce alone!
