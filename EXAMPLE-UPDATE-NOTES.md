# Updated Examples

All examples now use the AI city question:
**"What would a city designed entirely by AI optimize for, and would humans want to live there?"**

## Files Updated:
- ✅ Created new `examples/ai-city-output.md` with full example output
- ✅ Removed old Pietro example
- ✅ Updated all scripts to use AI city as example
- ✅ Updated all READMEs with new example

## Why This Example is Better:
1. **More engaging** - Everyone can relate to cities
2. **Multi-faceted** - Technical, social, philosophical angles  
3. **Current** - Smart cities are happening now
4. **Visual** - Easy to imagine the results
5. **Thought-provoking** - Makes you think about AI's role

## Note on Acknowledgments:
Pietro Schirano still appears in acknowledgments as the creator of make-it-heavy which inspired this project. This is appropriate attribution and remains unchanged.

## Try It Now:
```bash
cd ~/Developer/claude-code-heavy
./heavy-interactive.sh "What would a city designed entirely by AI optimize for?"
```

The example output shows how Research Assistants discover fascinating perspectives - from Singapore's surveillance state to Brasília's failed utopia!
